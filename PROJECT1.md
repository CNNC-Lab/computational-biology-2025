# Project 1: *Dynamics, representation and processing memory in networks of spiking neurons*

If you are working on Project 1, the first step is to install the NEST simulator. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html). NEST is particularly suited for Unix (Linux/Mac) systems, so if you use Windows it may be tricky to install and use it. In this case, the best option is either to install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and use Linux within Windows (see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)) or to run it in an independent and self-contained virtual machine (see instructions and download the virtual image [here](https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation/livemedia.html#live-media)). Alternatively, you can use other simulation software, such as [Brian](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [JAXley](https://jaxley.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Spytorch](https://github.com/fzenke/spytorch) or [Nengo](https://www.nengo.ai/).

**NOTE:** While the project aims to work on a very simple input mapping problem, encoding a continuous, time-varying, 1-dimensional input signal, you are welcome to explore the audio dataset used in Project 2.
